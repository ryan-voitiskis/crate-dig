# Dive Deeper: Introducing rekordbox ver. 7.0.0

AlphaTheta Corporation is pleased to release rekordbox for Mac/Windows (ver. 7.0.0), a complete DJ software application that integrates everything from music management to live performance capabilities.

This major update features significantly enhanced performance and new features using software learning, cloud, and automation technology. By significantly reducing processing loads and the time and effort needed for finding and managing music, automatically filtering tracks into categories, automatically setting cue points for tracks, and sharing playlists with other DJs, the new GUI design enhances intuitiveness for music management and gig preparation.

## New platform and GUI design bring huge improvements in software performance

### Vastly improved processing load

The updated platform achieved up to 56% reduction in CPU processing load compared to rekordbox ver. 6 and reduced power consumption during startup by 38%, enabling longer battery operation on PC/Mac devices. The software runs with noticeably reduced stress.

### Refreshed, smoother GUI for comfortable music preparation

The completely redesigned interface has been reviewed for efficiency, retaining effective elements from version 6. The key color changed to blue for unity with AlphaTheta and Pioneer DJ hardware. Both Dark and Light modes offer improved usability with clearer control grouping and enhanced waveform visibility.

## New browsing system efficiently finds music you want from a wide range of sources

### Media Browser

The [Media Browser] has transitioned from tree view to icon view, providing rapid access to desired tracks across multiple music sources.

### New browsing experience when using streaming services

Tracks display with artist images and album artwork for intuitive visual browsing. Clicking links for albums, playlists, or artist names reveals related songs.

### Collection Filter

The [Collection Filter] enables quick searching through large personal collections. Users can filter tracks by date, genre, artist, or album.

### Two Radar functions using software learning technology

- **Collection Radar** — Unearths forgotten tracks from personal collections, helping rediscover old favorites. Matches specified tracks and filters to find similar gems, matching tracks to specific venue or event requirements.
- **Streaming Radar** — Navigates new tracks from streaming services across tens of millions of songs and multiple platforms. Helps users add undiscovered tracks and build perfect playlists.

## A new era for your DJ workflow: software learning and automation tech significantly reduces prep time

### Intelligent Cue Creation

When adding tracks, the software automatically sets Hot Cues and Memory Cues based on learned preferences. The software learning of rekordbox ver. 7 picks up on trends in established cue point positions in other songs and automatically applies learned cue positions to new songs.

### Dual Player layout

Available in [Export] mode, the [Dual Player] layout enables checking track compatibility and finding optimal mix points. Linked player operations allow simultaneous play/pause, waveform navigation, and Beat Jump control with EQ Kill, Key Sync, and Key Shift options for experimentation.

### Column View

The [Column View] provides a hierarchical browsing structure similar to Mac Finder Column view, enabling playlist browsing while visually checking hierarchy. Offers intuitive folder and file searching with multiple playlist and track navigation.

### Collaborative Playlist

Sharing playlists with peers includes metadata such as song order, BPM, grids, and cue points for back-to-back sets or festival setlist preparation.

If you share a playlist that includes tracks from a streaming service, anyone who wants to use the playlist will need a subscription to that streaming service to access those tracks. Locally stored tracks require separate purchase by collaborators.

## Owner registration enables free control of selected new features

[Dual Player] layout, [Collection Filter], [Column View], and other paid features are available free when eligible DJ equipment is registered to an AlphaTheta account. These functions remain available even when DJ equipment is disconnected from PC/Mac. Registration is done through rekordbox ver. 7 with an AlphaTheta account.
