# Using ACTIVE CENSOR

You can apply effects automatically to specified sections of a track in advance.
For example, you can specify an expletive that should not be output. Turn on the ACTIVE CENSOR and play a track, replacing the expletive with an effect. Turn off the ACTIVE CENSOR for the track to be output as original.

**Hint**

- For the screen, see "[ACT. CENSR] (ACTIVE CENSOR) mode" (page 133).

1. Select [ACT. CENSR] on the performance pad.

2. Click [IN] at the position of the IN point (beginning) of the section you wish to specify.

3. Click [OUT] at the position of the OUT point (ending) of the section you wish to specify.
   [OUT] switches to [OUT ADJ]. [IN] switches to [IN ADJ].

**Hint**

- You can specify multiple sections in one track.
- An icon appears on the track list in the browser panel.

## To turn on the ACTIVE CENSOR to apply an effect

1. Click [ON/OFF].
   The enlarged waveform marker and the specified section are displayed in yellow.

2. Select an effect from [REV ROLL], [TRANS 1/8] (or [TRANS 1/4]), [ECHO], and [V.BRAKE 1/16 - 32].

3. Play the track.
   The effect is applied when playback position reaches the IN point marker.
   The effect is turned off when the playback position reaches the OUT point marker.

**Hint**

- An icon in the track list of the browser panel turns yellow.
- When [TRANS] or [V.BRAKE] is selected, you can change the beat parameter by clicking [<]/[>].
- You can set a different beat parameter for each specified section.

## To fine-tune an ACTIVE CENSOR section

When the playback position is within the specified section, the [IN] and [OUT] points are displayed as [IN ADJ] and [OUT ADJ] respectively. You can then adjust the IN point and OUT point.

### Change the IN point

1. Click [IN ADJ].
   The playback position moves to the IN point.

2. Move the IN point, and then click [IN ADJ].
   The IN point changes.

### Change the OUT point

1. Click [OUT ADJ].
   The playback position moves to the OUT point.

2. Move the OUT point and click [OUT ADJ].
   The OUT point changes.
