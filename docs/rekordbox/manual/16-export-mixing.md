# Mixing ([2 PLAYER] layout)

## Preparing for mixing

Mix tracks to find a good match combination or adjust beat grids.
A good match combination of tracks can be saved in the library and can be called as RELATED TRACKS when selecting the next track to play.

### To mix two tracks in Players A and B

1. Select [2 PLAYER] on the upper-left of the screen.
   The player panel is switched to [2 PLAYER] layout.

2. Drag a track from the track list, etc. to Player A.

3. Drag a track from the track list, etc. to Player B.

4. Click ► in the operation panels of Player A and Player B.
   The tracks in Player A and Player B start playback.

5. Adjust the mixing audio volume of Player A and Player B.
   You can try mixing with a crossfader in the operation panel.
   Move the crossfader to A to increase the volume of Player A and to decrease the volume of Player B. Move the crossfader to B to increase the volume of Player B and to decrease the volume of Player A.

### To adjust the track playback speed (Tempo Control)

Click the tempo adjustment button to match the playback speed of 2 tracks.

[+]: The playback speed becomes faster.
[-]: The playback speed becomes slower.
[RST]: The playback speed is reset to the original speed.
BPM value: You can enter the BPM by double clicking the number.

### To adjust the playback speed without changing the pitch (Master Tempo)

1. Click [MT] in the function panel.
   The [MT] lights up in red and the master tempo is turned on.

2. Click [+]/[-] to adjust the tempo (BPM).
   The pitch of the track does not change even when you change the playback speed.

**Note**

- The sound quality may change because the sound is digitally reprocessed.

### To adjust the beat positions of two tracks manually using Pitch Bend

Click the pitch bend down button to slow down the playback or the pitch bend up button to speed up the playback in the function panel during playback.

### To synchronize the beat positions and tempo of two tracks using BEAT SYNC

1. Play a track on Player A.
   The Player which starts the playback first becomes the Sync Master.

2. Play a track on Player B.

3. Click [BEAT SYNC] in the function panel on Player B.
   The Tempo (BPM) and beat positions of the track on Player B is synchronized with those on Player A.
   To turn the SYNC function off, click [BEAT SYNC] again.
   To get back to the original BPM on each player after turning the SYNC function off, click [RST].

### To set 2 tracks as a good match combination ([Matching])

If the 2 tracks are a good match to mix in terms of harmony, etc., click the matching icon to store such information in the library. The stored information can be shown as a good match combination.

- If the 2 tracks are a good match when loading these tracks onto the Player A and Player B, the matching icon lights up in blue automatically.
- To display tracks with good match combinations for a particular track, see "Using RELATED TRACKS" (page 32).

### Operating two tracks at the same time ([DUAL PLAYER] layout)

In the [DUAL PLAYER] layout, you can use DUAL CONTROL which allows you to operate two tracks at the same time.

[Screenshot: DUAL CONTROL toggle icons showing linked and unlinked states]

Click the DUAL CONTROL icon to turn on DUAL CONTROL.

DUAL CONTROL allows you to operate two players, Player A and Player B, in sync. You can operate two players at the same time with the play/cue/seek buttons on either player.

### Adjusting specific frequencies ([DUAL PLAYER] layout)

In the [DUAL PLAYER] layout, you can use [3 BAND EQ] to adjust the audio quality of each track individually. By enabling [HIGH], [MID], and [LOW], you can suppress (equalize) the frequency band and easily check it for mixing.
The settings for this function are not saved for the track.

### Adjusting the track volume ([DUAL PLAYER] layout)

In the [DUAL PLAYER] layout, you can use [AUTO GAIN] to adjust the volume of each track individually. [AUTO GAIN] loads the attenuation amount set when analyzing the track, and can be adjusted manually.
The settings for this function are saved for the track.

### Aligning the keys of two tracks ([DUAL PLAYER] layout)

[KEY SYNC] and the key shift function are available.
For details, see "Using the key shift function" in the PERFORMANCE mode (page 164).

**Note**

- Depending on your subscription plan and DJ equipment connected to your computer, the [DUAL PLAYER] layout may not be available. For details on subscription plan, refer to the rekordbox website.
