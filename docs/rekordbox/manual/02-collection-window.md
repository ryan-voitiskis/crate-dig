# [Collection]

[Collection] is a list of all tracks organized by rekordbox.
Tracks will be analyzed and added (imported) to [Collection] for use.
If you use rekordbox version 5 or earlier, you need to convert the library in the [Collection] to be imported. For details, refer to "rekordbox Introduction" on the rekordbox website.
Depending on your subscription plan, tracks can be added from not only your computer, but also a streaming service (PERFORMANCE mode) and Cloud Library Sync. For details, refer to "Streaming Service Usage Guide" and "Cloud Library Sync Operation Guide" on the rekordbox website.
