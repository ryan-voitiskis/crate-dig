# Using with DJ equipment

Connect the computer to the DJ equipment (DJ controller or DJ player) with a USB cable to control rekordbox on the DJ equipment. Refer to the Instruction Manual of connecting DJ equipment.
Be sure to read "Safety Precautions" and "Connections" in the Instruction Manual for the DJ equipment before connecting the equipment to your computer.
The latest information on DJ equipment supporting rekordbox is available on the rekordbox website and pioneerdj.com.

**Note**

- When a DJ player is connected via LAN with PRO DJ LINK, use EXPORT mode. For more details, see "Using the LAN connection" (page 109).
- You may be unable to properly operate the device depending on the USB connection status. This could be due to the bandwidth of the USB port and the USB hub on your computer. Changing the USB hub or port may solve the problem.
- For details, refer to the Instruction Manual for the DJ equipment. pioneerdj.com/en/support/documents/
