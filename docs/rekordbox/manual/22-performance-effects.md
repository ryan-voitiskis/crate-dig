# Using effect features

There are four effect modes in rekordbox; BEAT FX, SOUND COLOR FX, Release FX, and MERGE FX. The PAD FX feature enables you to operate these effects with the pads.
Popular effects in our DJ mixer (DJM series, etc.) and remix station (RMX series, etc.) are pre-installed in rekordbox, opening the door to a wide variety of DJ performances.
For controlling effects using a DJ controller, refer to the Instruction Manual of each DJ controller.

**Hint**

For the screen, see "Effect panel" (page 136).

**Note**

- Depending on your subscription plan and DJ equipment connected to your computer, this function may not be available. For details on subscription plan, refer to the rekordbox website.

## Displaying the effect panel

Click [Screenshot: FX icon] in the global section to display or hide the effect panel.
To switch an effect panel, open the [Preferences] window > [View] category > [Layout] tab, and set [Effect Panel] in advance.

## Selecting decks for the effects

When using BEAT FX and Release FX, select decks on which to apply effects in the effect panel.

- Decks 1 to 4: Click [1] to [4].
- Sampler deck: Click [S].
- Master out: Click [M]. When the master out is selected for effects, you cannot assign effects to any other deck or the sampler deck. If you assign effects to the master out when any of decks 1 to 4 or sampler deck have effects already assigned, those assignments are disabled.

**Hint**

- For the sampler deck, see "Sampler deck" (page 139).

## Using BEAT FX

You can use various effects to match the tempo (BPM) of a track loaded to the deck.
Furthermore, you can control two effect units, [FX1] and [FX2], allowing you to assign a deck for each unit.
BEAT FX has two effect modes.

- "To use Beat FX multi-mode" (page 177)
- "To use Beat FX single-mode" (page 178)

### To use Beat FX multi-mode

You can use up to three effects at the same time for each effect unit. Before using this mode, select the deck on which to apply the effects.

[Screenshot: Beat FX multi-mode panel showing FX1 with deck selector (1-4, S, M), three effect slots showing DELAY, ECHO, and PITCH with individual FX LEVEL/DEPTH knobs and beat selectors showing 1/1, 1/1, and 0%]

1. Switch to Beat FX multi-mode.

2. Turn on effects.

3. Select an effect.

4. Adjust the balance of the original sound and effect sound. (FX LEVEL/DEPTH)
   For example, when you select [ECHO], you can use the knob to coordinate how much echo is mixed on the original track.
   The original sound is output when the knob is turned fully counterclockwise.
   The sound with the effect is output when the knob is turned fully clockwise.

5. Select the number of beats to apply to effects in sync with the BPM.

**Hint**

- For some effects, including [REVERB], a parameter value is set instead of beats.
- If you select a beat-based effect and a parameter-based effect, and turn them on at the same time, both the beat and parameter values are displayed.

### To use Beat FX single-mode

You can select one effect per effect unit. Before using this mode, select a deck on which to apply the effect.

[Screenshot: Beat FX single-mode panel showing FX1 with deck selector (1-4, S, M), ECHO effect selected with FEEDBACK, FILTER controls, REV and FREEZE buttons, FX LEVEL/DEPTH knob, and beat selector showing 1]

1. Switch to Beat FX single-mode.

2. Turn on the effect.

3. Select an effect.

4. Save multiple parameter settings that are adjusted in the single-mode. (SNAPSHOT)
   You can call the saved parameter settings when you select the effect.
   The position of FX LEVEL/DEPTH is not saved.

5. Adjust the balance of the original sound and effect sound. (FX LEVEL/DEPTH)
   For example, when you select [ECHO], you can use the knob to coordinate how much echo is mixed on the original track.
   The original sound is output when the knob is turned fully counterclockwise.
   The sound with the effect is output when the knob is turned fully clockwise.

6. Select the number of beats to apply to effects in sync with the BPM.
   For some effects, a parameter value is set instead of beats, or these buttons are not enabled.

7. Adjust the effect level.
   The parameter differs for each effect.

8. Turn on the parameter to light up in blue, and you can change the effect level.
   The parameter differs for each effect.

### To set the BPM of effects

There are two modes for setting BPM; [AUTO] and [TAP]. Click [TAP] or [AUTO] to select the mode. The [AUTO] mode is set by default.

- [AUTO] mode: The BPM of a track loaded to a deck is the benchmark BPM for the effect. You can apply the effect in sync with the BPM of the track for each deck.
- [TAP] mode: Click [TAP] several times in rhythm to set the BPM as the base value for the effect.

## Using Release FX

Release FX is a function to apply effects, to cancel BEAT FX, and to enable smooth transition of the currently playing track and the effect sound.
You can also set to turn off SOUND COLOR FX.

1. Click [Screenshot: selector icon] in Release FX in the effect panel to select an effect.

   [Screenshot: Release FX selector showing VINYL BRAKE selected with beat selector showing 3/4]

2. Click [Screenshot: left arrow] / [Screenshot: right arrow] to select a beat.
   Set the length of the Release FX.

3. Click and hold the effect to be applied.
   The effect name lights in blue while the effect is applied.

4. Release holding to turn off the effect.
   The effect name is displayed in white at the same time.

## Using SOUND COLOR FX

SOUND COLOR FX enables you to change the intensity of various effects according to the position of its [COLOR] knob. You can easily arrange tracks by selecting an effect and turning the knobs.

SOUND COLOR FX has two effect modes.

- "To use SOUND COLOR FX single-mode" (page 180)
- "To use SOUND COLOR FX multi-mode" (page 181)

**Hint**

- The number of knobs displayed on the screen depends on the connected DJ products.
- If no DJ product is connected, [COLOR] knobs and parameter knobs for [CH 1] to [CH 4] are displayed.
