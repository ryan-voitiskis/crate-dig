# Using a Playlist

You can organize tracks on rekordbox by creating playlists.
Playlists have two display formats: tree view and column view, and you can choose your preferred one.
In the PERFORMANCE mode, you can also operate Automix playback using playlists. See "Using Automix playlists" (page 166).

Right shows Column View selected with the same playlists listed. Both views have a plus button for adding new playlists.]

## Creating a new playlist

1. Click the plus button on the right side of the playlist or playlist folder in the tree view.
   A new playlist ([Untitled Playlist]) is added under [Playlists].

2. Enter the playlist name from your computer keyboard, and then press the [Enter] key.

3. Click [Collection] in [Media Browser].
   Tracks in [Collection] are displayed in the track list.

4. Display the playlist in the sub browser, and drag and drop a track to the playlist.
   The track is added to the playlist.

**Hint**

- You can add tracks to the playlist from [iTunes], [Tag List], or other playlists.
- To delete a playlist, right-click the playlist, and then select [Delete Playlist]. Alternatively, you can delete a playlist by selecting the playlist, and then pressing the [Delete] key on the computer keyboard.
- To remove a track from the playlist, right-click the track in the playlist, and then select [Remove from Playlist]. Alternatively, you can remove a track from the playlist by selecting the track in the playlist, and then pressing the [Delete] key on the computer keyboard.

### Using the created playlist in other applications

You can save the created playlist in ".txt" or ".m3u8" format, and export it to other music applications.

1. Right-click the playlist.

2. Select [Export a playlist to a file].

3. Select [Export a playlist to a file (_.txt)] or [Export a playlist to a file for music apps (_.m3u8)], and then save the playlist.

## Importing a playlist file

Playlist file formats M3U (.m3u), M3u8 (.m3u8), and PLS (.pls) can be imported.

1. From the [File] menu on the upper screen, select [Import] > [Import Playlist].

2. Select a file name from a folder stored with playlist files, and then click [Open].
   The selected playlist is added to [Playlists].
   Tag information of the music files, which are contained in the playlist, is displayed.
   If [Auto Analysis] is set to [Enabled], analysis of the music files begins. For details, see "Analysis of music files" (page 14).
