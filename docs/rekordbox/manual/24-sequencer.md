# Using a sequencer

rekordbox has a sequencer function which allows you to record, play, and store the sequences you play at the sampler deck. Enjoy various DJ performances with this sequencer. You can create original rhythm loops or vocal loops in advance to overlap the playback track, use the overdubbing function to add samplers such as improvised finger drums, or use the mute function to remove particular sounds.

**Hint**

- For the screen, see "Sequencer panel" (page 140).

## To record the sequence (Overdub recording)

# Loading a sequence to a deck (SEQUENCE LOAD)

Drag and drop the display of a sequencer panel to a player panel deck. The sequence is loaded to the deck with a track name of "PATTERN _(_)".

- To start loop playback of the whole sequence after loading, open the [Preferences] window > [Controller] category > [Sampler] tab > [SEQUENCER] > [Sequence Load], and select [Load the sequence and automatically play].
- The sequence track is created when the marker on the sequence beat counter reaches the right edge. If the recorded sequence is not correctly loaded, play the sequence until the marker reaches the right edge, and then drag and drop again.
