# Using with DJ equipment (PRO DJ LINK)

Be sure to read "Safety Precautions" and "Connections" in the Instruction Manual for the DJ equipment listed below before connecting the equipment to your computer.

For the compatibility of SD memory cards and USB storage devices (flash memory or hard disk) with the DJ equipment, refer to the Instruction Manual for each equipment.

The latest information on DJ equipment supporting rekordbox is available on pioneerdj.com.

You can also read "Pro DJ LINK setup Guide" on the rekordbox website.

## Using USB storage devices for DJ performance (USB EXPORT)

If the DJ equipment is not connected to a computer, you can use rekordbox tracks on DJ equipment from USB storage devices (such as flash memory and hard disk).
