When the STEMS function is enabled, the buttons for the function are displayed on the deck, effect panel, and mixer panel.
You can select either [3 Stems (VOCAL, INST, DRUMS)] or [4 Stems (VOCAL, INST, BASS, DRUMS)] in the [Preferences] window > [Extensions] category > [STEMS] tab > [STEMS Mode].

**Note**

- For controlling the TRACK SEPARATION function using a DJ controller, refer to the operation manual of each DJ controller.

## Using ACTIVE STEM

## Using DRUM SWAP

You can replace or add the DRUMS Stem of a track loaded on the deck with the drum loop audio source.

[Screenshot: DRUM SWAP interface showing numbered labels 1-4, with DRUM LOOP BANK A/B tabs, four DRUM SWAP SLOTs (House 1, House 2, Techno 1, Breaks 1), SINGLE/MULTI mode buttons, GAIN control, and VINYL BRAKE with beat controls]

   By switching the DRUM LOOP BANK, you can load drum loop audio sources into a total of 8 DRUM SWAP SLOTs across each deck. For details on how to load drum loop audio sources, refer to "Loading drum loop audio sources to DRUM SWAP SLOT" (page 210).
   When you point the cursor to each DRUM SWAP SLOT, the [Play] button, [Unload] button, [DRUM SWAP SLOT GAIN] knob, BPM, and LOOP beats are displayed.

   [Screenshot: Close-up of a DRUM SWAP SLOT showing Play button, Unload button, GAIN knob, and beat count display reading "123 | 4"]

   Click the [Play] button to sync with the beat position and BPM of the deck and start loop playback from the beginning. When you click the button during playback, the playback stops.
   - The length of the track playable in the DRUM SWAP SLOT is up to 32 beats. When a track with longer than 33 beats is loaded into the DRUM SWAP SLOT, it loops from the beginning of the track by 32 beats.
   - The same DRUM SWAP SLOT cannot be played simultaneously on BANK A/B.

     - Perform reverse playback on the deck.

3. Playback mode for DRUM SWAP
   - DRUM SWAP SINGLE MODE (SINGLE)
     Select this mode when replacing the drums of the track loaded in the deck with the drum loop audio source in the DRUM SWAP SLOT.
     - When playing DRUM SWAP SLOT, the ACTIVE STEM (DRUMS) of the deck turns off.
     - When DRUM SWAP SLOT stops, the ACTIVE STEM (DRUMS) of the deck turns back on.
     - Only one DRUM SWAP SLOT can be played at a time. Multiple DRUM SWAP SLOTs cannot be played simultaneously.
   - DRUM SWAP MULTI MODE (MULTI)
     Select this mode when adding drum loop audio sources of individual instruments such as kick, snare, and hi-hat to the track loaded in the deck.
     - DRUM SWAP SLOT is played. The ACTIVE STEM (DRUMS) remain on.
     - Multiple DRUM SWAP SLOTs can be played simultaneously.

[Screenshot: Save menu showing "Save as New Preset" option with GAIN control and preset icons]

1. Click the save icon and select [Save as New Preset].

2. Enter the Drum Preset name and click [OK].
   The currently loaded drum loop audio sources of all DRUM SWAP SLOTs in DRUM LOOP BANK A/B are saved as Drum Presets.

**Hint**

- The saved Drum Presets can also be selected and loaded from [User Preset] on another deck.

## Using DRUM RELEASE FX

You can apply RELEASE FX to the DRUMS Stem of a track loaded on the deck, or to the DRUM SWAP SLOT currently playing in DRUM SWAP SINGLE MODE.

[Screenshot: DRUM RELEASE FX controls showing numbered labels 1-3, with VINYL BRAKE effect name, dropdown selector, and beat up/down buttons displaying "< 1/2 >"]

## Using DRUM CAPTURE

You can extract the DRUMS Stem of a track loaded on the deck and use it for DRUM SWAP.

[Screenshot: Enlarged waveform with numbered labels 1-2, showing the DRUM CAPTURE button and extraction range indicator on the waveform]

1. DRUM CAPTURE
   Click the DRUM CAPTURE button to display the extraction range from the current position on the waveform, and a white frame will appear on all DRUM SWAP SLOTs for all decks.

   [Screenshot: Close-up of enlarged waveform showing the extraction range highlighted with a white frame border]

   [Screenshot: DRUM SWAP interface showing all DRUM SWAP SLOTs with white frames indicating they are ready to receive the captured DRUMS Stem]

   When you click the DRUM SWAP SLOT displayed with the white frame, the DRUMS Stem of the extraction range is loaded into the clicked DRUM SWAP SLOT.

2. Display/change DRUM CAPTURE range
   Each time you click the beat count button, the extraction range will be changed to 4 beats -> 8 beats -> 16 beats -> 32 beats -> 4 beats ->...

**Hint**

- When you click the DRUM CAPTURE button during a loop play, the extraction range is set from the loop in point.
- On the [Preferences] window > [Extensions] category > [STEMS] tab > [DRUM CAPTURE], you can select [DRUMS Stem] or [Original track].
  When you select [Original track], the entire audio of the original track is extracted instead of the DRUMS Stem.
- You can specify the location for saving the extracted files on the [Preferences] window > [Extensions] category > [STEMS] tab > [DRUM CAPTURE].

**Note**

- Files with the extension ".rbsc" extracted from the DRUMS Stem can be used in the PERFORMANCE mode or LIGHTING mode of rekordbox for Mac/Windows under the account from which the DRUMS Stem was extracted.
  Extracted files cannot be used in the following:
  - EXPORT mode and EDIT mode
  - USB Export function
  - LINK Export function
  - CloudDirectPlay function
  - rekordbox for iOS/Android
