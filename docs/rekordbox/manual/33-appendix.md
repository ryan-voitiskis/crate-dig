# Communications environment on the computer

Depending on your computer's security software and operating system settings, communications with DJ equipment or mobile devices may be interrupted. If this occurs, check your settings for the following 4 programs to ensure that they are not blocked. The program extension depends on the OS of the computer; e.g. the extension ".app" is for Mac and ".exe" for Windows:

- rekordbox
- edb_streamd
- rbhttpserver
- rbcloudagent.exe

When sharing of the computer's internet connection is enabled, problems may arise in communications with other computers or DJ units connected on the LAN. Disable sharing before connecting the computer to the LAN.

- Mac: Open [System Preferences], and uncheck [Internet Sharing] under [Sharing].
- Windows: Open [Local Area Connection Properties], and then at [Sharing], uncheck [Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection] under [Internet Connection Sharing].

Communications with DJ equipment or mobile devices may also be interrupted if the network (IP address, port number, etc.) is restricted by a router or another communications device.
For details on the communications devices, security software, and the settings of the operating system, contact the respective manufacturer or your sales agent.
