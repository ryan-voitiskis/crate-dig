# Recording

You can record analog sound of your DJ performance or input through connected hardware.
Recordings are created as WAV files.

**Hint**

- For the screen, see "Recording panel" (page 142).

**Note**

- Depending on your subscription plan or the DJ equipment connected to your computer, you may not be able to record. For details on subscription plan, refer to the rekordbox website.

### To start recording

1. Click [Screenshot: recording icon] in the global section.
   The recording panel is displayed.

2. Select a recording source.
   To record with the internal mixer mode, select [Master Out].
   Depending on the recording sources and the connected hardware, settings of the connected hardware may be necessary. For details, refer to the operating instructions of the connected hardware.

3. Turn the recording level knob to adjust the recording level.
   Start playback of some tracks on the connected hardware, check the recording level indicator, and adjust the recording level accordingly.
   - If the level is too low, recorded files will contain noise and the volume will be low.
   - If the level is too high, clipping will occur and the sound will be distorted.
   The best recording quality can be obtained by increasing the maximum recording level to the point where not all the indicators hit the red zone.

4. Click [Screenshot: record button].
   [Screenshot: record button] flashes and rekordbox is in the recording standby mode.

5. Play a track to be recorded on the connected hardware.
   Recording starts when audio input is received. [Screenshot: record button] changes to [Screenshot: recording active icon], and the elapsed time and remaining time for recording are shown.

6. Click [Screenshot: stop recording icon].
   Recording stops.
   When no sound continues more than 20 seconds, recording stops automatically.

7. Enter information about the recorded file.

8. Click [OK].
   Click [Screenshot: save icon] of [Media Browser] to save the recorded file on [Recordings] in the tree view.

**Hint**

- To avoid automatic start/stop recording, open the [Preferences] window > [Controller] category > [Recordings] tab > [Recording starts when:] and [Recording ends when:], and set to [Pressing the REC button.]. Recording starts when you click [Screenshot: record button], and recording stops when you click [Screenshot: stop recording icon].
