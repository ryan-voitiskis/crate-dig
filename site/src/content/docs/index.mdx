## What reklawdbox does

reklawdbox is an MCP server that sits between your AI agent and Rekordbox 7.x.
It gives the agent structured access to your library while keeping your
database safe. All metadata changes are staged in memory and exported as
XML — the Rekordbox database is never modified directly.

- **Reads the encrypted Rekordbox `master.db` directly** using SQLCipher.
  The database is opened read-only — reklawdbox never writes to it.
- **Stages metadata changes in memory** (genre, comments, rating, color)
  so you can review them before anything is exported.
- **Exports Rekordbox-compatible XML** for safe reimport.
  Your database is never modified directly.
- **Enriches tracks via Discogs and Beatport** — pulls release metadata,
  labels, catalog numbers, and artwork through a broker API and HTML extraction.
- **Analyzes audio with stratum-dsp and optional Essentia** — computes BPM,
  key, energy, danceability, and spectral features from your actual audio files.
- **Scores transitions and builds DJ set sequences** — uses harmonic
  compatibility, BPM proximity, energy curves, and genre affinity to find
  optimal track ordering.
- **Provides CLI subcommands** for batch audio analysis and native file tag
  read/write outside of MCP.
