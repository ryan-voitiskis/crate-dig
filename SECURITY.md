# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities privately.

Preferred method:

1. Open a GitHub Security Advisory draft (Security tab -> Report a vulnerability).
2. Include reproduction details, impact, and any proof-of-concept.

If advisories are unavailable, contact the maintainer through a private channel with the same details.

Do not post vulnerability details in public issues before a fix is available.

## Include

- Affected component(s) and file paths if known
- Preconditions and attack scenario
- Step-by-step reproduction
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Suggested mitigation (optional)

## Disclosure Process

- We will acknowledge receipt and triage severity.
- We may request additional validation details.
- We coordinate a fix and release plan before public disclosure.
