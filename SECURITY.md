# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest `main` branch state.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately.

Preferred method:

1. Open a GitHub Security Advisory draft (repository "Security" tab -> "Report a vulnerability").
2. Include reproduction details, impact, and any proof-of-concept.

If Security Advisories are unavailable in your environment, contact the project maintainer through a private channel and include the same details.

Please do not post vulnerability details in public issues before a fix is available.

## What to Include

- Affected component(s) and file paths if known
- Preconditions and attack scenario
- Step-by-step reproduction
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Suggested mitigation (optional)

## Disclosure Process

- We will acknowledge receipt and triage severity.
- We may request additional validation details.
- A fix and release plan will be coordinated before public disclosure.
